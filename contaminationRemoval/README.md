### Removing contaminants from fastq files
### ! Under Construction !
### About 
This directory contains 3 different versions of the 'remove contaminants.py' script.
The main function of this script is to remove sequences classified as contaminants from fastq files.

The contamination removal step can be detailed by the following flowchart:

![contamination_removal](/images/contamination_removal.png)

### Usage
1. Split large kaiju file into pieces running `submit_slit_large_kaiju_file.sh`
2. Generate an index_db for the fastq files running `create_fastq_indexdb.py`
3. And then, run `v4.remove_contaminants.py`

### Outputs

* `R1 and R2 filtered.fastq files`: Contains only sequences that have a taxonomic level within the taxonomic level entered by the user (e.g Viridiplantae) 

* `R1 and R2 unclassified.fastq files`: Kaiju's unclassified sequences and sequences classified outside the taxonomic level entered by the user (e.g every taxonomic level outside Viridiplantae)

### Benchmarking
Different versions of this script have different structures and the runtime benchmarking is described below:

|      | v1        | v2        | v3        | v4        |
|------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| real | 4m16.855s | 0m47.112s | 0m12.245s |           |
| user | 4m6.304s  | 0m39.913s | 0m9.743s  |           |
| sys  | 0m0.663s  | 0m0.537s  | 0m0.550s  |           |

The shorter runtime of version 3 is a consequence of storing the sequence id with its index, this process is performed with the biopython 'SeqIO.index' function.

In addition, version 3 writes the new filtered file while reading the raw fastq file. So only one line at time is stored in memory.
